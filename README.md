* Dont forget to enter your password in connection.js
* notice how we reuse addToTable and getAllEntriesFromTable!!
* This code could be much shorter and easier to read: alot of controller functions do basicly the same thing, and we are invoking displayInfo 5 seperate times
* Notice how we seperated model from view from controller and what each does. 
* notice how much bulkier and less readable code becomes once we have questions inside addRole function, as opposed to questions defined in a seperate file
* notice the error handling that will allow you to try a different funcition if one you selected doesnt exist or work. 

* OOP would also be a good pattern for this code!
